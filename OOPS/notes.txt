As C language is a Procdural language and we used to divide into functions
We used to define variables as global which will always be alive and local variables can also be a choice 
Can't have 2 functions with same name as they are global 
With OOPs we can define scopes of fucntions variables
Java in OOPS is better than C++ as no multiple inheritance hence much more cleaner 
Data binding happens here :
In Java, data binding is the connection between class and method, or class and field. 
Makes it more scalable maintainable reusable 

Class and Object:
Class is a blueprint Eg wrt to real life example :Humans 
Object is Realtime 
Heap memory is created with new and all objets are stored here
initially acc to our program id-0 name-null salart:0.0 
class loads to the space in meta space :data about data 
OOPS+SOLID 
S : SRP:Single Responsibilty Principle
Ek class ki ek Responsibilty similarly for functions
We must also follow DRY :Do not reapeat yourself 
we must make a employee data class employeeIO class and EmployeeAllocation all must be separated to follow SRP
this is optional to write 
Encapsulation:Binding data and methods into a Single unit ans this a called a class 
Good encapsulation :Data hiding (variables hide)+ functions are public 
 called with class hence called methods and if without then theyare called fucntions
 Every Class has a default constructor 
 when we create an object we call an constructor and default constructor gets call which actually does nothing 
constructor -object constructor constructor call
It is used to intilize instance variables(obejct create)  of a class 
Class name and constructor name must always be same constructor doesn't return anything 
Even it is not void 
If we want to call both constructors then we have to do constructor chaining this()
and we must place it at the top() hence 1st statement :as we need to intilize with this and it won't be possible then 
we can't modify the values of private variables like hence use setters 
Class =member variables +member function
Encapsulation is binding data members +function into a single unit as class
ram=new Student() initialize which goesto the Heap memory
but ram is in the stack ,class also goes to heap which is in a section called meta space 
Memeory is created when object is created ie instance is created
Deafult constructor gets killed if we create a default constructor by ourself
on printing an array we get hashcode
with var it takes data types by itself hence provides flexibily and uses concept of type inference 
Hence it does it implicitly and doesn't need to be done explicitly

Class relationship :
Two classes want to communicate with each other 
a) IS-A :Based on inheritance :Prent child relationship
*inheritance
*Polymorphism :One thing having seveler forms 
b) HAS-A (Object create and use it)-Usage based relationship
Account and Customer are two classes
then Customer has a Account

Saving Account is a Account 
HomeLoan is a Loan

Scopes in Java 
Local scope is within some {} or a method
    // default scope here int id !! i.e within the folder menas the package 
    // protected (within the package ,outside the package using inheritance)
    // private is within the class 
    // public accesible everywhere
    // no global scope is allowed in Java 
Overriding needs ISA 
Parent and Child method should be same 
Overriding is needed to as parent method is outdated 
@Override is an annotation which gives notice to compiler and developer that we have done Overriding
Hence we touched Polymorphism :One thing having seveler forms
Eg:Overriding 

abstract class and methods 
Account class ka object  should not be made at any cost  as it will not be able to define itself 
So to resolve it make the class abstract
It is a generic class hence has common features hence we use it only for inheritance

    // public void computeRoi(){
    //     System.out.println("Account ROI is 3%");
    // }
    // must be defined by class and is compulsory then the child class will also become abstract
