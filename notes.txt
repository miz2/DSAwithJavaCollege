Taking input in java :
commandline arguments
 javac Input.java
 java Input 23
 hence we have made a command:this is our cutomized command

 System.in.read()

 Buffered Reader:ile Input2.java

 Scanner :file Input3.java

 Syste.console():generally used for passwords such that they are hidden 

 %10 ->Digit last 
 %100 second last 
 power to change position
  
  recursion allows us to go bakc to history and we can return 
  which is not available in loops 
  works on stack
with O(n);
if we fill the stack in recursion we may get StackOverflowError at runtime 
which cant be treated hence never try to make infinity loop with recursion

recursion maintains stack and goes forward and backwards
works on pre call and post call

function calls iteself
solve small problem 
base case is needed 
maintain stack 
Types of recursion:
direct :tail head and tree
indirect
